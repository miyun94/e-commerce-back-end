  ## Description
  This application is set up with Express.js API and uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It creates the back end for an e-commerce site where the user is able to create, update, and delete data in the database and have it displayed in a formatted JSON for an easy view.


  ## Installation
  Here are the steps to get the application up and running: 
  Git clone the repo and in the terminal or commandline, be sure to run 'npm install' in order to get the npms needed to run the application.

  ## Usage
  Once everything is installed properly, open the commandline and make sure to run mysql to connect to the schema and seeds. Then back at the root of the terminal or commandline, run the application by using 'npm start'
